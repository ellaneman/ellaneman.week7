        <h3>Why Revolve...?</h3>
        <p> E-Commerce has a huge role on the internet, so I decided to compare and contrast two e-commerce websites, <a href="http://www.revolve.com/women/?navsrc=main">revolve.com</a> and <a href="https://www.missguidedus.com">missguided.com</a> . For my example of successful website I chose revolve.com. Revolve clothing is an e-commerce website which carries over 500 womens and mens brands. If a person were to encounter the website for the first time they would easily be able to accomplish the basic tasks. I mean I understand that online shopping isn't so complicated to understand, but Revolve has a great tool bra and is categorized very well, and there also there sub-categories which can refine your searches for clothing to smaller groups in order to find exactly what you looking for, when looking for something specific. The learnability of the site is extremely easy because the website is full of information that is easy to access and find. The website is super efficient because all the images on their site loads super quickly and are not pixilated at all.  Another successful element of this website is when going onto the site on your mobile phone the website functions and fits in the screen correctly and nothing is tangled up or overlapping, since the screen is significantly smaller than an average computer.  </p>

    <h3>Why Not Missguided...?</h3>
        <p> For my choice of an unsuccessful website I chose, <a href="https://www.missguidedus.com">missguided.com</a> . Miss Guided is an e-commerce website which sells in-house clothing for millennial women. At first glance the website is super busy and crowded so your eye doesn't know where to look to see how to start about searching/shopping. So the learnability of this site isn't so simple. In my opinion the most unsuccessful part of this website is itâ€™s efficiency. Everything on the page takes quite sometime to load, also the bar tool loads slowly, including the loading of the sub-categories within the toolbar. The images of the clothing on the site is just as slow as well, and when you put your curser on the image to see a quick slide show, the switching of photos lags. Like I stated before, online shopping is not too difficult of a task so if errors were made they would be too severe to recover. Personally I don't love the aesthetic of the design of this website because everything about it seems to messy an busy which makes me want to stop using the site, because it seems more complicated. </p>
